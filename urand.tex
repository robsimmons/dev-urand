\title{A modest proposal for the purity of programming}
\author{Robert J. Simmons \and Tom Murphy VII}

\begin{abstract}
  Terrible ideas permeate the world of programming languages, and the
  harm that these ideas do is lasting. Academic research is intended
  to ameloriate some of this harm, but the connection between academic
  PL research and industry grows ever more tenuous. This harms both
  realms. Terrible ideas continue to hold back the benefits that
  computer science and software enginnering seek to bring to the
  world.  On the other side, we should note the demoralizing effect of
  this tendency on academic PL research: why work on ``practical''
  research if you will be universally ignored?

  The more principled among us might suggest that we continue to
  generate the best ideas and see what happens, that the right ideas
  will win in time. The time for such velvet-glove approaches is long
  past. This is a war, and it is time to use all the resources at our
  disposal. We propose a method and apparatus to save the world from
  itself.

\section{Introduction}

Why are programming langauges important? Why are they broken? What is our approach to fixing it?

How does patent law work, and how does it allow us to stomp out bullshit?

Examples of history: SIGBOVIK/Milner idea

- different levels of patent from rock solid to pure troll-threats

We are going up against some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Larry Wall and Guido van Rossum.
